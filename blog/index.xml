      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post on my new blog.  I&amp;rsquo;m planning on using this space to write about things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on, from learning Java, navigating Drupal, or rocking out with some SASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting for me to get this site launched.  Previous sites that I&amp;rsquo;ve made for myself have been Drupal sites, and really they were vehicles to learn Drupal.  This site is made with Hugo, a static site generator that runs on Go.  After cutting my teeth on Drupal for the past year and a half or so, its been really refreshing to work with something so nimble.  More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
