Hello World!
<!--more-->
This is the first post on my new blog.  I'm planning on using this space to write about things that I'm working on, from learning Java, navigating Drupal, or rocking out with some SASS.

It's also exciting for me to get this site launched.  Previous sites that I've made for myself have been Drupal sites, and really they were vehicles to learn Drupal.  This site is made with Hugo, a static site generator that runs on Go.  After cutting my teeth on Drupal for the past year and a half or so, its been really refreshing to work with something so nimble.  More on that later.
