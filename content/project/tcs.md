Working with designer [Alice Bacon](http://www.celloalice.com/), we developed a new website for The Chelsea Symphony - a cooperative, self-governing orchestra based in Manhattan. This project had both an inward and outward looking focus. Primarily, the orchestra sought to refresh their online presence, as well as create a platform for its musicians that reflects it's cooperative structure.<br>
