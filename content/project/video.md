To help build audiences, I produce a series of short videos to promote upcoming concerts. Coming from a background in music, I research the pieces being played, interview the performers on camera, and edit down to a short video. Some recent interviews have been with Jolle Greenleaf - founder of TENET, Suzanne Farin on her album *Corpo di Terra,* and composer Robert Honstein on his Vivaldi project.<br>
