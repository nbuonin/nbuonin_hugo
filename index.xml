      <description>&lt;p&gt;www.ferandedecruck.com is a multi-lingual Drupal site, built in support of the mission to reintroduce Decruck&amp;rsquo;s work to the public. Working on this project was especially exciting because of the challenge of localization in Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A First Post</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post on my new blog.  I&amp;rsquo;m planning on using this space to write about things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on, from learning Java, navigating Drupal, or rocking out with some SASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting for me to get this site launched.  Previous sites that I&amp;rsquo;ve made for myself have been Drupal sites, and really they were vehicles to learn Drupal.  This site is made with Hugo, a static site generator that runs on Go.  After cutting my teeth on Drupal for the past year and a half or so, its been really refreshing to work with something so nimble.  More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chelsea Symphony</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with designer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.celloalice.com/&#34;&gt;Alice Bacon&lt;/a&gt;, we developed a new website for The Chelsea Symphony - a cooperative, self-governing orchestra based in Manhattan. This project had both an inward and outward looking focus. Primarily, the orchestra sought to refresh their online presence, as well as create a platform for its musicians that reflects it&amp;rsquo;s cooperative structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To help build audiences, I produce a series of short videos to promote upcoming concerts. Coming from a background in music, I research the pieces being played, interview the performers on camera, and edit down to a short video. Some recent interviews have been with Jolle Greenleaf - founder of TENET, Suzanne Farin on her album &lt;em&gt;Corpo di Terra,&lt;/em&gt; and composer Robert Honstein on his Vivaldi project.&lt;br&gt;
